# NFT-Auctions
We are tackling is to accurately predict auction closing prices in Ethereum for a set of 13828 NFTs. 


We tried as many different types of models as we can to identify which has the most potential. The methods we used include Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LightGBM), Random Forest, Epsilon-Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The Kaggle MAE on the public leaderboard for those 4 models are 15.12958, 9.52078, 9.33971, and 8. 93930 respectively. Thus, we can conclude that SGD seemed to perform best on the dataset
